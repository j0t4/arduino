# Arduino & compatible clone MCUs
Arduino AVR compatible microcontrollers sketch test and circuit review for ATMega328P, LGT8F328P, STM32...etc on selected projects.

In the learning of Arduino and its clone chips, there will be frustration moment merely because the information is not sufficient.

Therefore, this channel is to help understanding via the physical hands-on process documented.
