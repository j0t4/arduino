# Arduino 328 & compatible clone MCUs
Arduino AVR compatible microcontrollers physical test and review for ATMega328P, LGT8F328P, STM32...etc on selected project sketches.

In the learning of Arduino, especially dealing with clone chips such as LGT8F328P, there often lack of information on how the final circuitry is setup and running successfully   although the usage and description were given, somehow you may find physical implementation can be different.

For example, there are many version of LarduinoISP projects, this section will show you the one that is physically tested and working.
