# Arduino platform compatible MCUs
The hands-on guide to the use of Arduino platform compatible microcontrollers such as ATMega328P, LGT8F328P, STM32...etc.

In the learning of Arduino and compatible clone chips, there will be difficult moment merely due to lack of information.

This channel contains success information from the findings during the physical sketch programming and circuitry implementation using Arduino platform compatible MCUs.
