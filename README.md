# Arduino & compatible clone MCUs
Arduino AVR compatible microcontrollers sketch test and circuit review for ATMega328P, LGT8F328P, STM32...etc.

In the learning of Arduino and compatible clone chips, there will be difficult moment merely due to lack of information, and implementation may not be the same as the original circuit diagram.

This channel is to document information from the findings during the physical hands-on process.
