# About this Arduino Testlab
Arduino AVR compatible microcontrollers testlab for ATmega328P, LGT8F328P, STM32...etc

In the learning of Arduino, especially dealing with clone chips such as LGT8F328P, there are lacking information on how the final circuitry is setup and running successfully.  Although description text is given, you may find physical implementation can be different.

For example, there are many version of LarduinoISP projects, this section will show you the one that is tested and working.
