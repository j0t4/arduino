# Arduino & compatible clone MCUs
Arduino AVR compatible microcontrollers sketch test and circuit review for ATMega328P, LGT8F328P, STM32...etc.

In the learning of Arduino and its clone chips, there will be frustration moment merely because the information is not sufficient and the implementation may not be the same as the circuit diagram or guidelines given.

Therefore, this channel is to share information documented from the findings during the physical hands-on process.

# LGT8F328P.PDF
Contains information about how to burn BOOTLOADER using LarduinoISP with the use of LGT8F328P clone chips.
