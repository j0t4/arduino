# Arduino & compatible clone MCUs
Arduino AVR compatible microcontrollers sketch test and circuit review for ATMega328P, LGT8F328P, STM32...etc.

In the learning of Arduino and compatible clone chips, there will be difficult moment merely due to lack of information.

This channel contains success information from the findings during the hands-on of sketch programming and circuitry implementation using Arduino and compatible MCUs.
